ProjectBaselineAPI
==================

Data import / export to the Project Baseline database.<br>

This project is intended to use on the Project Baseline API to import data.<br>
Feel free to contact me for support <br>

  or if you don't have twitter trough http://zeep-vinkeveen.org/contact<br>

The idea is to import comma separated files with titles above the fields.<br>
Can be created in google docs or simmular.<br>
This project will then generate an connection to the Project Baseline API and import the files.<br>

To confirm everything is working I also need to check if the data that is put in will come out as espected.
