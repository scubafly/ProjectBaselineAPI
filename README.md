ProjectBaselineAPI
==================

data import / export to the Project Baseline database

This project is intended to use on the Project Baseline API to import data.
Feel free to contact me for support
  twitter: @scuba_fly 
  or if you don't have twitter trough http://zeep-vinkeveen.org/contact

The idea is to import comma separated files with titles above the fields.
Can be created in google docs or simmular.
This project will then generate an connection to the Project Baseline API and import the files.

To confirm everything is working I also need to check if the data that is put in will come out as espected.
